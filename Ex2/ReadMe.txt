The exercise has 8 points 


Things that work well:
The first 4 are working properly with good modifications that are made to suit the assignment requirements


Major Problems:
Points 5-8 have a lot of unresolved errors. the design doc indicates how they should behave with their structures and interactions, but I didn't have time to solve all the errors.

some current problems prohibit compilation, but I reached several segmentation faults. and the piping is not complete at all.
